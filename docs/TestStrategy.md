# Test Strategy for Task Manager Plus API

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Test Strategy document is to define the testing approach for the Task Manager Plus API. It outlines the testing levels, methodologies, tools, and responsibilities to ensure that the API meets the required quality standards.

### 1.2 Scope
This Test Strategy covers all functional aspects of the Task Manager Plus API, including task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. It also defines how non-functional aspects such as performance and security will be addressed, although they are out of the current testing scope.

## 2. Test Approach

### 2.1 Testing Levels

#### 2.1.1 Unit Testing
- **Objective**: To validate that individual units of the API (e.g., functions, methods) work as expected.
- **Tools**: Mocha, Chai
- **Responsibility**: Developers

#### 2.1.2 Integration Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure that the integrated modules of the API work together as expected.
- **Tools**: Mocha, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers

#### 2.1.3 System Testing
- **Objective**: To validate the end-to-end functionality of the API, ensuring it meets the specified requirements.
- **Tools**: Mocha, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers

#### 2.1.4 Regression Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure that new changes do not adversely affect the existing functionality of the API.
- **Tools**: Jenkins/GitHub Actions (for automation), Mocha, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers

### 2.2 Test Types

#### 2.2.1 Functional Testing
- **Description**: Testing the API to ensure it performs the intended operations, covering all CRUD operations.
- **Focus Areas**: Task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

#### 2.2.2 Negative Testing
- **Description**: Testing the API with invalid inputs to ensure it handles errors gracefully.
- **Focus Areas**: Invalid task data, unauthorized access, invalid endpoints.

#### 2.2.3 API Contract Testing
- **Description**: Verifying that the API adheres to the defined contract (e.g., correct response formats, required fields).
- **Focus Areas**: HTTP status codes, response structure, data validation.

## 3. Test Tools

### 3.1 Test Automation Frameworks
- **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework running on Node.js, used for unit and integration testing.
- **Supertest**: A library for testing HTTP assertions, used to test API endpoints.
- **Chai**: An assertion library that works with Mocha to provide BDD/TDD assertions.

### 3.2 CI/CD Tools
- **Jenkins**: An automation server used to continuously integrate and test the API.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub repositories for automated testing.

### 3.3 Test Management Tools
- **Jira**: Used for managing test cases, logging defects, and tracking testing progress.
- **Confluence**: Documentation tool for storing and sharing test strategy, plans, and other related documents.

## 4. Test Data Management

### 4.1 Test Data Creation
- **Approach**: Test data will be created dynamically during test execution to ensure a clean test environment. Data will be generated programmatically using predefined templates.

### 4.2 Test Data Types
- **Valid Data**: Typical user inputs that the API is expected to handle.
- **Invalid Data**: Edge cases, boundary conditions, and erroneous inputs to validate the robustness of the API.

### 4.3 Test Data Storage
- **Temporary Storage**: Test data will be stored temporarily during the test execution and cleaned up after the test to maintain an isolated environment.
- **Persistent Storage**: Not applicable, as tests will not rely on pre-existing data in persistent storage.

---

## 5. Test Environment

### 5.1 Environment Setup
- **Development Environment**: Local machines or dedicated development servers will be used to run tests during development.
- **Test Environment**: A separate test environment that mirrors the production setup will be used for executing the test cases.

### 5.2 Configuration Management
- **Version Control**: All test scripts and configurations will be maintained in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub).
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, tokens) will be managed using environment variables and not hardcoded in the test scripts.

---

## 6. Test Entry and Exit Criteria

### 6.1 Entry Criteria
- API development is complete and deployed to the test environment.
- Test environment is configured and accessible.
- Test cases are developed and reviewed.
- Test data is prepared and validated.

### 6.2 Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases are executed.
- All critical and major defects are resolved or deferred with appropriate justification.
- Test summary report is reviewed and approved by stakeholders.
- No high-severity defects are open.

---

## 7. Defect Management

### 7.1 Defect Tracking
- **Tool**: Jira will be used to log, track, and manage defects found during testing.
- **Severity Levels**: Defects will be classified based on their impact on the system (Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial).
- **Defect Lifecycle**: Defects will follow a defined lifecycle from "Open" to "Closed" with intermediate states such as "In Progress," "Resolved," and "Reopened" if necessary.

---

## 8. Risk Management

### 8.1 Identified Risks
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Risk of requirements not being fully understood or documented.
- **Environment Issues**: Risk of the test environment being unstable or not mirroring production.
- **High Defect Density**: Risk of discovering a high number of defects that could delay the release.

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies
- **Requirements Review**: Conduct thorough reviews and clarify any ambiguities before testing.
- **Environment Monitoring**: Regular checks and validations of the test environment setup.
- **Early Defect Triage**: Prioritize defects early in the testing phase to avoid last-minute delays.
