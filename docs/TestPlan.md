# Test Plan for Task Manager Plus API

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Test Plan is to outline the testing strategy for the Task Manager Plus API. This document describes the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for the testing activities. It identifies the test items to be tested, the features to be tested, and the features not to be tested.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this Test Plan covers functional testing of the Task Manager Plus API. This includes testing the creation, updating, and deletion of tasks, ensuring that the API behaves as expected in various scenarios.

### 1.3 Objectives
- To verify that the Task Manager Plus API meets the specified requirements.
- To ensure the API is robust and handles various inputs and edge cases correctly.
- To validate the API's functionality across different endpoints and operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- To ensure the API handles error conditions gracefully.
